# Startle Response Experiment Analysis and Documentation

## Contents
- Python Notebook for the preliminary analysis of recording data
- Python Notebook for the trend analysis of the preliminary analysis data
- Documentation for the setup and procedure of startle response experiments as well as instructions on using the notebooks
- Example files from previous recordings (excluded for now due to file size limitations; example notebook outputs should be preserved)

## How to get the files
- download and open Visual Studio Code
- on the start screen, select `Clone Git Repository...` and type in this repository's name
- you now have a local copy of the files; you can edit and delete them without any changes to this repository
- if you ever want to restore the original files, overwriting any changes you made, head to the "Source Control" tab on the left (or press Ctrl+Shift+G) to pull the repository again <!-- this and probably the step before requires git; we should probably just tell them to download and unpack the source code (or make a full on tutorial for that OR put a copy of all of this onto the recording computer, though that would take a while to move around if we include the example files) -->
