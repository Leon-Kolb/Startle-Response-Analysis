TODO:

- rewrite abstract and introduction
- smooth out discussion
- fix Lauer references (2018 not 17?)



- normality test once fine? or per plot? per plot/tests
- more photos
- %PPI table fix
- include outliers exp peakvalue and reactiontime


remove peak decay fit
try exponential fit for rise, try to find point to get better reaction time (start at bg noise)
not higher but longer reactiontime
overlay satter on %PPI, color dots male and female (same for experiment)
exclude decay tau, only expo tau

did we group ASR control male and female too?
also check if females have smaller PPI than males, if same we can use both sexes 
rename rec order to animal? 
ASR control per animal not per experiment, so per animal per day
only on day one did we have the mice out in the open, day 2 and 3 in noise chamber (do a plot like for dates)






After we're done:
- make it idiot proof
