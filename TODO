Mihai on vacation after August 21st, so discuss on 18th (Monday)
back on 9th-10th


- check if the strength and everything changes after 2nd mouse onwards or in what way it decreases (or RT increases) 
- do literature search and investigate further

- AUC seems to be the most consistent strength metric across date and sex

- fix missing citations

- summarize results

- connect paragraphs

- check and rewrite introduction

- THREE categories: reaction time, strength and the decay fit


After we're done:
- update Protocol 
- make everything portable
- make it idiot proof
