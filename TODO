Mihai on vacation after August 21st, so discuss on 18th (Monday)
back on 9th-10th

- get: %PPI, IPI, max 100ms, peak-to-peak amplitude (50 ms), max peak-to-trough (200 ms), first peak (50 ms), RMS (???ms)

- shorten link to raw data in thesis

- pubmed search stancu myelin for paper for ethics statement

- background level comparable to r420h mice maybe (for thesis writing) real cba comparison with littermates

- check if the strength and everything changes after 2nd mouse onwards or in what way it decreases (or RT increases) 
- do literature search and investigate further



After we're done:
- update Protocol 
- make everything portable
- make it idiot proof
