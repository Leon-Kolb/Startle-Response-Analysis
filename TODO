TODO:
- fix missing citations
- connect paragraphs
- check and rewrite introduction
- figure descriptions
- refine figures
- explain background top recordings *plallert and longenecker
- give data for eff str dates male vs female
- fix tables


discussion: 
  louder background for testing offset ASR again
  increase trial amount to compensate for top removal of prepulseless ones (we can go up in trials since session length is short enough)
  change gap duration to move window TOWARDS startle instead of away to avoid 100ms window and thus facilitation
  RMS may be the best strength metric, but AUC might be useful for avoiding sex differences
  session length might be an issue due to fatigue and/or increased inhibition due to stress
  IPI not just dependent on gap length but also on animal stress


Questions:
- what do we do with difference? wait for mihai


After we're done:
- update Protocol 
- make everything portable
- make it idiot proof 
- ende november, 4 wochen, HIWI physio kurs
