Mihai on vacation after August 21st, so discuss on 18th (Monday)
back on 9th-10th



- shorten link to raw data in thesis

- pubmed search stancu myelin for paper for ethics statement

- background level comparable to r420h mice maybe (for thesis writing) real cba comparison with littermates

- check if the strength and everything changes after 2nd mouse onwards or in what way it decreases (or RT increases) 
- do literature search and investigate further

- check if we exclude too many recordings -> LOT'S of offset trials excluded -> mostly consists of (all) offset ASRs

- check for correlation between peakValue and AUC / tau



After we're done:
- update Protocol 
- make everything portable
- make it idiot proof
