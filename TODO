- missing recordings
- SDT implementation: separate top 10?
- which threshold multiplier? 
    -> problem if too high: delayed reaction time (7: mult = 20, 8: 10, 9: 6, 10: 3, 11: 20 for det, 6 for RT, 12&13: 20|9) -> use high one for peak detection, low one for reaction time measurement? 
    -> problem 2: too low could falsify result as well, making it too early (20|9 looks ok?)
    -> problem 3: changing between 60, 50, 40, 30 and 20 for det threshold changes amount of hits by a lot
    -> weigh FPR against miss rate empirically -> 20-35 picks up bad ones, 40 misses some valid ones -> use 40 to be safe?

- do we even need peakTime and difference?
- strength normalization ok? what scaling factor?
- ValueG or DeltaG?
- How do we handle discarded recordings? What do we say about them / how to we write about and analyze them?
- with 4th recording we could model age effects better
- do the top 10 hit rates even mean anything? same with any analysis run on them?
- why are hit rates so high? probably ok though, just seems odd
- what's the right strain?
- what goes into the figures and tables section of the thesis?
- what site to share raw recording data?
- does separating results by experiment make sense? Maybe instead by sex, age, etc.

- data analysis update for 3rd recording
