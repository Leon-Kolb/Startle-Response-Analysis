TODO:
- fix missing citations
- connect paragraphs
- check and rewrite introduction
- figure descriptions
- refine figures
- explain background top recordings *plallert and longenecker
- give data for eff str dates male vs female


discussion: 
  louder background for offset ASR?
  increase trial amount to compensate for top removal of prepulseless ones? (we can go up in trials since session length is short enough)
  change gap duration to move window TOWARDS startle instead of away to avoid 100ms window and thus facilitation?

top 10: plot %ppi on y and top on x for peakvalue, so does %ppi change with the top recordings?
  something seems wrong with how we take the top recordings
  always show %PPI instead of raw values; always put in relation to prepulse
  remove prepulseless ones from tops, only take prepulse trials
-------> there is no top difference

gap duration should go into the PPF threshold since the window goes into the 100ms range I think since the window moves away from the startle; could explain %PPI

remove ASR control from ALL analysis since its only use for %PPI
---> effects stay the same

recording order:
  check if ASR control ALSO decreases, otherwise PPI goes higher (if ASR control increases then they are STRONGER with stress)
---> nope, weaker even for ASR control


Questions:
- what do we do with difference? wait for mihai


After we're done:
- update Protocol 
- make everything portable
- make it idiot proof 
- ende november, 4 wochen, HIWI physio kurs
