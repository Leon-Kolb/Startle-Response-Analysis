- missing recordings -> it's fine, software error
- SDT implementation: separate top 10? -> no
- which threshold multiplier? -> 6, 24
    -> problem if too high: delayed reaction time (7: mult = 20, 8: 10, 9: 6, 10: 3, 11: 20 for det, 6 for RT, 12&13: 20|9) -> use high one for peak detection, low one for reaction time measurement? 
    -> problem 2: too low could falsify result as well, making it too early (20|9 looks ok?)
    -> problem 3: changing between 60, 50, 40, 30 and 20 for det threshold changes amount of hits by a lot
    -> weigh FPR against miss rate empirically -> 20-35 picks up bad ones, 40 misses some valid ones -> use 40 to be safe? -> 6, 24

- strength normalization ok? what scaling factor? -> removed
- How do we handle discarded recordings? What do we say about them / how to we write about and analyze them? -> too few to be important
- with 4th recording we could model age effects better -> no
- do the top 10 hit rates even mean anything? same with any analysis run on them? -> no we merge them anyway
- why are hit rates so high? probably ok though, just seems odd -> looks fine
- what's the right strain? -> R420H (heterozygote, ours are WT (not homo or heterozygote)) CBA/J WT Jackson Lab (KCNC3 genotype)
- what goes into the figures and tables section of the thesis? -> figures and tables...
- what site to share raw recording data? -> found one
- "The data was checked for
spherificity using Mauchlyâ€™s test. If the assumption failed, the
Greenhouse-Geisser correction was then applied. A value of
p,0.05 was considered statistically significant. Furthermore, post-
hoc tests were done with Bonferroni adjustment to compare within
subject significance analysis."         -> is our procedure ok?   -> this is for PPI frequency, not interesting for us     
- why mice slow?               -> old measurements from the 80s, different method  
- why is peakTime so often 30 
- try to get background noise only while mouse stands still -> median, not average -> why so low? -> it's fine



- how do we measure strength, in what time window? -> 500 ms, test RMS, AUC, decay time constant (slop, exponential fits) and peak amplitude and split up strength analysis to those 4
- k=3 or k=6 for measurement? -> 3 -> no 6


- give maximum units, also give avg for males and females then give avg difference -> done


- do we even need peakTime and difference? -> lesser strength = more time to reach it? -> SAVE AND USE MAX VALUE INSTEAD!

Mihai on vacation after August 21st, so discuss on 18th (Monday)
back on 9th-10th

- shorten link to raw data

- pubmed search stancu myelin for paper for ethics statement

After we're done:
- update Protocol and Analyzer
- make it idiot proof 

- Wednesday 10:00

- notebookfm

- exclusion messes up top 10 collection -> solved

- redo basically all of Analyzer and make it also return usable values

- make RESULTS_DATES df even if useless just for completion's sake

- background level comparable to r420h mice maybe (for thesis writing) real cba comparison with littermates

- check if the strength and everything changes after 2nd mouse onwards or in what way it decreases (or RT increases)
also do literature search
investigate further


check if we exclude too many recordings -> LOT'S of offset trials excluded -> mostly consists of (all) offset ASRs
check for correlation between peakValue and AUC / tau
